**Shopee Cart System Implementation Challenge Report**

This report summarizes the improvements and implementations made in the project to implement an online shopping cart system inspired by the Shopee interface, using Node.js for the backend and real-time cart state synchronization.

**Addressed in the Challenge:**
1. **ECMAScript Standard:** The entire codebase was refactored to follow the ECMAScript standard, ensuring consistency and compliance with JavaScript best practices.
   
2. **English Names:** All variable names, functions, and comments were translated into English, promoting consistency and facilitating collaboration in international teams.
   
3. **Complete Implementation:** All shopping cart functions were fully implemented, including adding items, calculating the total, removing items, deleting items, and displaying the cart.

4. **Accurate Total Calculation:** The cart total calculation was adjusted to ensure accuracy, using the `toFixed(2)` method to round the result to two decimal places.

5. **Appropriate Comments:** Explanatory comments were added at key points in the code, aiding in understanding and future maintenance.

**Beyond the Base Code:**
1. **Function Name Refactoring:** Functions were renamed to reflect actions more clearly, such as `addItem`, `calculateTotal`, `deleteItem`, `removeItem`, `displayCart`.

2. **Implementation of Missing Functions:** The `deleteItem` and `displayCart` functions, which were missing in the base code, were implemented.

3. **Enhanced Business Logic:** The business logic was enhanced to ensure that cart operations, such as adding, removing, and calculating the total, work correctly in all situations.

4. **Separate Module Architecture:** The code was organized into separate modules to facilitate maintenance and extension of the system in the future.

**Conclusion:**
The Shopee cart system implementation challenge was successfully completed, meeting the established requirements and implementing significant improvements. The refactored code and new implementations ensure a robust, efficient, and scalable system, providing a seamless and interactive online shopping experience for users.
